                    street or at other public places, such as markets or fairs. It is often sold from a portable food
                    booth,[1] food cart, or food truck and is meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are
                    regional, but many have spread beyond their regions of origin. Most street foods are classified as
                    both finger food and fast food, and are typically cheaper than restaurant meals.

            <p class="text-big">Spring Rolls</p>
            <p class="text-small">Spring rolls were a seasonal food consumed during the spring, and started as a pancake
                filled with the new season's spring vegetables, a welcome change from the preserved foods of the long
                winter months.[1] In Chinese cuisine, spring rolls are savory rolls with cabbage and other vegetable
                fillings inside a thinly wrapped cylindrical pastry. They are usually eaten during the Spring Festival
                in mainland China, hence the name. Meat varieties, particularly pork, are also popular. Fried spring
                rolls are generally small and crisp. They can be sweet or savory; the former often with red bean paste
                filling, and the latter are typically prepared with vegetables. They are fully wrapped before being
                pan-fried or deep-fried.
                Non-fried spring rolls are typically bigger and more savory. Unlike fried spring rolls, non-fried spring
                rolls are typically made by filling the wrapping with pre-cooked ingredients. Traditionally, they are a
                festive food eaten during the Cold Food Day festival and the Tomb Sweeping Day festival in spring to
                remember and pay respect to ancestors. The Hakka population sometimes also eat spring rolls on the third
                day of the third month of the lunar calendar (三月三 sān yuè sān). The wrappings can be a flour-based mix
                or batter.</p>

                original taiwanese hakka dishes. it has evolved to be one of the popular indian street foods. especially
                with indo chinese recipes thriving in india. hakka noodles and schezwan noodles have easily marked its
                presence.
                There is a subtle difference between normal noodles recipe and veg hakka noodles recipe. firstly, the
                main difference between those two is the style of preparations. basically, this recipe is tossed fried

            <p class="text-big">Pasta</p>
            <p class="text-small">Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed
                with water or eggs, and formed into sheets
                or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are
                sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free
                alternative. Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.
                Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca). Most dried
                pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh
                pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines.[3] Fresh pastas
                available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.</p>
